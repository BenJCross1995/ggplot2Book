# ggplot2 - Hadley Wickham

This repository contains the code as well as my notes for the book ggplot2 (2nd Edition) by Hadley Wickham.
This book is an introduction to the ggplot2 package in R, which is extremely usefuly for creating plots using the 
Grammar of Graphics. A link to the upcomming third edition of the book is [here](https://ggplot2-book.org/).


I am also creating notes for each chapter of the 2nd edition of the book in 
[Notion](https://boundless-spoon-d09.notion.site/ggplot2-a4943fc7d78a4d748d324a49c10f49c5), including code input
and any output as screenshots. Feel free to take a look at that shared page also.
